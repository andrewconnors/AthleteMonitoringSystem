# AthleteMonitoringSystem
Frontend App for determining athlete injury potential in real time.
This was an application my peers and I developed as a demonstration of our senior design project in software engineering back in 2017. We also developed a design for sensors that attached to an athlete's legs in strategic locations and pulled data from them in real time. The goal here was to monitor an athletes performance in the gym and in real game scenarios to alert medical staff if the data suggested a deviation from the normal activity, indicating an injury.

In order to run the app on your local machine, Xcode will need to be installed. Navigate to the .xcworkspace file and open it in xcode.

## Installing dependancies
In a terminal window, navigate to the folder containing this project and run the command ```pod install``` **note, you may have to install cocoapods first**

## Run the App
Run the app by clicking the "Play" button in the top of the xcode window.

## More Information
For more information on the project, please reach out to me and I will send you the completed business plan which goes over more detail involving the technology and the proposed go-to market plan.
